## Reporting Security Issues

We take the security of the AntBot project seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability within the project, we appreciate your cooperation in responsibly disclosing your findings to ensure the security and privacy of our users.

### Guidelines for Reporting Security Issues

To report a security issue, please follow the steps below:

1. **Do Not Publish the Issue Publicly:**
   - Refrain from opening up a public issue on GitHub, discussing the vulnerability in public forums, or sharing it publicly in any manner until it has been resolved.

2. **Use the Dedicated Reporting Channel:**
   - Report the vulnerability directly to us by using the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/Bucanero06/AntBot/security/advisories/new) tab.
   - Alternatively, you can email us at [security@carbonylllc.com](mailto:security@carbonylllc.com) with the relevant details.

### What to Include in Your Report

Please provide as much information as possible to help us understand the nature and scope of the issue, including:

- The type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.).
- The full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue.
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL).
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue.
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue.
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible).
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the vulnerability.

This information will help us to triage your report more quickly.

### Handling of Security Reports

1. Confirm receipt of your report.
2. Conduct a thorough investigation and determine the impact and potential solutions.
3. Work on a fix and coordinate a release with you, ensuring that proper credit is given for the discovery.
