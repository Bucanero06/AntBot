### Deployment Guidelines

#### Initial Setup

1. **Prerequisite Installation:**
    - Install the latest version of Docker for compatibility and specific feature support:
      ```bash
      sudo snap refresh docker --channel=latest/edge # Incorporates essential fixes
      ```

2. **Repository Initialization:**
    - Clone and prepare the AntBot repository:
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/Bucanero06/AntBot.git
      cd AntBot
      ```
    - Verify `.env` file configuration for environmental consistency.

#### Container Deployment

1. **Container Initialization:**
    - Deploy Docker containers efficiently, ensuring build and execution in a non-interactive mode:
      ```bash
      docker-compose up -d --build
      ```

2. **Log Monitoring:**
    - For comprehensive logs:
      ```bash
      docker-compose logs -f
      ```
    - For targeted container logs:
      ```bash
      docker-compose logs -f <container_name>
      ```

3. **Docker-Compose Specification:**
    - Utilization of docker-compose version 2.2 is strategic for optimal resource management within a VM environment,
      despite version 3.x offering the latest features.

### Technology Stack Synopsis

The AntBot project integrates an array of leading-edge technologies, each contributing uniquely to the system's overall
performance and versatility:

1. **FastAPI & Uvicorn:**
    - Implements a modern, high-performance framework with Uvicorn serving for high concurrency and reliability.

2. **Pydantic & Redis:**
    - Employs Pydantic for robust data structuring and Redis for fast, scalable data processing.

3. **Supplementary Technologies:**
    - Nginx, Asyncio, Wave, VectorBT(PRO), Nautilus Trader, and TradingView enrich the stack with capabilities ranging
      from request management to advanced backtesting and market analysis (under development) 

4. **Additional Components:**
    - Incorporates Websockets, Requests, Docker, GCP Logging & Monitoring, Firebase (GCP), and OAuth2 to fortify the
      infrastructure, security, and operational monitoring.
    - Prometheus and Grafana are being integrated to provide comprehensive monitoring and alerting.

Each of these has many features yet to be fully integrated into the AntBot project, but the potential for expansion
and enhancement is vast, many low-hanging fruits are available for the taking. 

### TradingView Alerts Configuration

A forthcoming feature includes an automated alert creation and management page. Initial steps to set up alerts using the
LuxAlgo Premium Indicator are detailed, emphasizing customization and webhook integration for comprehensive strategy
alerting.

### Legal Disclaimer

### Creating the TradingView Alerts

Automated Alert Creation and Management Page coming soon

```
e.g. LuxAlgo Premium Indicator
    i   - Create Alert on {ASSET}
    ii  - Set Alert "Condition" to ["LuxAlgo Premium"]["Any Confirmation"]
    iii - Set Alert "Action" to "Webhook"
    iv  - Set appropriate "Expiration Time" (e.g. 1 hour, 1 month, Open-ended)
    v   - Set "Webhook URL" to your Hosted app URL (e.g. http://your-app-ip:your-port/yourtvendpoint)
            make sure to select the Webhook URL check box so that the alert is sent using the Webhook
    vi  - Name Alert Name (e.g. "LuxAlgo Premium") to something that is easy to identify in the logs
    vii - Add the Message as found in the json payload examples below, you can customize the message to your liking
    viii - Create Alert - Congratulations you just set up your first TradingView Strategy Alert Webhook!
            if you want other conditions to trigger alerts, repeat steps i-viii since LuxAlgo Premium Indicator
            does not allow for custom webhooks  explicitely but you easily adjusted. This application is designed to be used with the LuxAlgo Premium Indicator
            but can be used with any TradingView Strategy Alert Webhook that is sent in the correct format.
            See the TradingView Webhook Documentation for more information on how to create a custom webhook and notify
            the bot of your custom webhook format for entries and exits. *TODO: See the "Expanding the Bot" section in this 
            ReadMe for more.*
